					<h1>About Koontz Kustom Guitars </h1>
					<p>
						I founded Koontz Guitars in 2016 somewhere between the Atlantic Ocean and the Florida Everglades
						in the Hurricane Winds of Miami, FL. U.S.A. <br /> <br />
						From 1994 to 2007, I toured extensively with my punk rock band, Against All Authority. After
						abusing my guitars for so many years, I became very interested in creating what I loved the
						most. <br /> <br />
						One day I got tired of buying stock guitars to modify and change them to fit my needs. That led
						me to create my first model, The Tropic Thunder. <br /> <br />
						Using my background in Punk Rock DIY ethics, I design and draw out my instruments by hand. Then
						I build them mainly using hand tools, utilizing the best quality hardware and electronics
						available. <br /> <br />
						Sorry if some of my sweat soaks into the wood of your brand new hand-built guitar. <br /> <br />
						Check out my <Link to="/repairs">repair services</Link> and some of the guitars I&apos;ve built
						by request. <br /> <br />
						Check out Jon Nu√±ez rocking one of my guitars, The Maverick, with his band, Torche. Hint:
						he&apos;s the guitar player that doesn&apos;t sing and plays the leads.
